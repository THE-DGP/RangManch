                  The origin of this festival goes way back to the mythological era of the Vaishnav Period, which marks the 
                  triumphant victory of King Hiranyakashipu’s son Prahlad over his own father, as he foiled all the plans which 
                  were meant to kill him. When he sat on the holy pyre along with holika, who was the king’s sister, Prahlad 
                  escaped unharmed while holika got charred to death. Thus this moment was etched in 
                  the glorious pages of history and is celebrated as the auspicious occasion of ‘Holi’ till date.
                  On the eve of the festival, a ritualistic bonfire is lit which is called Kacy Dahan along with prayers. 
                  On the main day, scented water of different ayurvedic colors made out of medicinal herbs, either in liquid 
                  or powdered form are thrown and applied on each other, as a symbol of fun and joy. In Mathura, a town in 
                  north India, Holi is a week long celebration and goes beyond playing with colors. On the day of Holi, 
                  women playfully beat the men with sticks and men go around with shields to defend themselves in a fun manner.

                  To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark an occasion to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end 
                    conflicts and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the past.
                    It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before 
                    Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. 
                    People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as Dhuli in Sanskrit, or 
                    Dhulheti, Dhulandi or Dhulendi, is celebrated.
                    In Northern parts of India, children and youth spray coloured powder solutions (gulal) at each 
                    other, laugh and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (abir) on each other's faces. 
                    Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as gujia, 
                    shakkarpaare, matri, and dahi-bada), desserts and drinks. After playing with colours, and cleaning up, 
                    people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.

                  Most Indian state has their own way of celebrating Holi. The celebration begins with Holika bonfire on 
                  the night before Holi. People gather, sing and dance around the bonfire and pray for the safety of their 
                  loved ones. The process of bonfire is the same all over. The next day of Holi begins early morning where 
                  people are free to play with colors. Participants play, chase and color each other with dry powder and colored water, 
                  with some carrying water guns and colored water-filled balloons for their water fight. This celebration 
                  is accompanied with songs and dance in a colorful and joyful atmosphere.

                  People visit family and friends to throw colors on each other; laugh and chit-chat and then share Holi
                   delicacies i.e. food and drinks. Bhang is mixed into drinks and sweets and consumed by many to enjoy 
                   the day. Bhang is prepared by mixing the leaves and flowers of the female cannabis plant. It has been 
                   consumed as a beverage since ancient times during this festival. In the evening when the celebration ends, 
                   everyone sobers and returns to their chores.
