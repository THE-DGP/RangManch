                  Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims, commemorating the revelation of the Qur'an. 
                    During this month, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, focusing on self-control, 
                    gratitude, and compassion for the less fortunate. It's a time of spiritual rejuvenation 
                    with extra prayers and Qur'an reading. Some individuals, like pregnant or nursing women, 
                    the sick, or the elderly, are exempt from fasting.

                    The school of thought you follow will depend on how long you believe the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) received the 
                    revelations, and this will also dictate the answer you believe to be true for the question of ‘when did Ramadan 
                    start in history?’ Those who believe the revelations took place over 23 years are of the firm belief that 
                    the teachings of Sawm (and subsequently Ramadan) were revealed towards the latter half of that period of time, 
                    in around 622 A.D. to be exact. At this time, the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his followers lived in Medina 
                    after they faced fierce persecution in Mecca when they tried to spread the words of Allah (SWT). At this 
                    time, the weather was particularly hot, and this influenced the name of Ramadan when it was first revealed. 
                    Ramadan means ‘burning heat’ in an ode to the time of the year it was first revealed, and this time of year 
                    marries up with Laylat al-Qadr, which happened some 12 years prior.

                  As per the history of ramadan fasting, there are several reasons why Muslims are asked to do so. To demonstrate 
                  self-control, to cleanse their bodies, To be reminded that some people do not have access to food and go hungry 
                  every day, To be more compassionate and grateful for what they do have and to strengthen their bond with Allah (SWT).
                  Time spent not eating during Ramadan should be spent reciting the Qur’an and praying instead. It is also a requirement 
                  that all Muslims with food in excess of their means make a charitable payment called Fitrana. It is traditional for 
                  Muslims to break their fast for their Suhoor, Iftar and Eid ul-Fitr celebrations by eating dates. This is a custom 
                  that goes back to the very first observance of Ramadan, as it is said that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ate dates before
                   he broke his fast. Though it is a custom, it is not a requirement.

                  Ramadan's core traditions take place at nighttime. Nowadays people use battery operated 
                  decorative lanterns inside homes and your porch to help give the festive Ramadan glow. People Scent their homes,
                  share the iftaar with neighbours. Eid cards and gifts are exchanged with loved ones. 
                  Charity and giving are important aspects of Ramadan—and they can be something families do together. 
                  Well to do people choose charities or activities where they can donate their money or time. 
                  Whether they give money to a worthy cause that's dear to their hearts, conduct a food drive, 
                  or volunteer with a local organization, it's a great way to give more generously during the season.
