                  Navratri, also called as Sharadiya Navratra, is one of the most eminent festivals of the Hindu community. 
                  It is a religious festival dedicated to the Goddess Durga. The word Navratri has been derived from Sanskrit 
                  words ‘nava’ meaning nine and ‘ratri’ that means nights. It is a celebration that involves rituals as well as fasting. 
                  The auspicious event of Navratri is celebrated in the month of Ashbin or Ashwayuja of the Hindu calendar, i.e. 
                  September or October.

                    This nine-day festival of Navratri is observed to commemorate the victory of the divine powers of Hindu deity 
                    Durga over the evil. As per the legends that rule Hindu religion, 
                    Goddess Durga stamped down the malicious fiend named Mahishasura after nine consecutive days of war.
                    Mahishasura was an ardent follower of Lord Shiva. However, on winning supreme powers of eternity from the Lord 
                    for his impassioned devotion, he transformed into a devil and indulged in malign acts of mercilessly killing 
                    innocent people. And so the supreme Trinity, comprising Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Mahesh, gave birth to 
                    the warrior Goddess Durga to wage a war against the devil. The war continued for nine consecutive days. 
                    It was on the tenth day that the Goddess beheaded the devil.

                  One of the most prominent rituals in the nine days of worship is fasting. Devotees fast for all nine days and 
                  worship the Goddess. Customary devotional songs, including aarti and bhajans, are sung throughout the 
                  merriment by the worshipers. The offerings during the worship include several types of dry fruits and sweets. 
                  Also, whether you are fasting or not, Hindu families refrain from eating the use of onion and garlic. Devotees 
                  also hold back from taking non-vegetarian food items and alcoholic drinks.
                  According to the age-old traditions, each day is dedicated to a different manifestation of Goddess Durga. 
                  The nine manifestations of the Goddess are namely Durga, Bhadrakali, Amba or Jagdamba, Annapoorna Devi, 
                  Sarvamangala, Bhairavi, Chandika or Chandi, Lalita, Bhavani and Mookambika.
                  The customs and traditions on these nine days of Navratri include sowing of barley seeds in mud and 
                  lighting up lamps or diyas before the idol of the Goddess. Also, in some states, devotees of the Goddess 
                  honour and worship nine young girls on the last day of the festival. This practice is termed as ‘Kanjak’ 
                  or ‘Kanya Pujan’.

                  Navratri is feted nationwide with full devotion and enthusiasm. However, the way of celebration may vary. 
                  As per the customs followed in the southern part of India, in the initial three days people offer prayers 
                  to Goddess Durga, while Goddess Lakshmi is revered during the next three days. During the last three days 
                  of Navratri, Goddess Saraswati is idolized. In West Bengal, the nine days of festivity is observed as 
                  Durga Puja. The celebrations include installation of huge Pandals in temples, while devotees bring home 
                  bright colorful statues of the Goddess to their homes and offices. In Gujarat, the upbeat festival of devotion 
                  is referred to as Garba Navratri. Traditional music and popular folk dance Garba fill the celebrations with overwhelming 
                  fervor and heartiness. The aura of this festival is enthusiastically tuned with bright-hued traditional wears,
                   such as Cholis, Badhani Dupattas and Ghagra.
